# Evergreen

A friendly game about a lost druid finding her way in life.

## Run

Although this can be cross compiled to many platforms, the primary platform is WASM.

The blow command will create a webserver so you can run the game.

```bash
 cargo run --target wasm32-unknown-unknown                                   
```

Note: You may need other bevy specific prerequisites for your OS to build this.
